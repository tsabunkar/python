# Python Language Features

- Dynamic, high level, free open source and interpreted programming language
  - Dynamic: we donâ€™t need to declare the data-type of variable because it is a dynamically typed language (bocz variable is decided at run time).
  - high level: no need to manage the memory
  - interpreted: Python code is executed line by line at a time. unlike other languages C, Java. there is no need to compile python code
- supports object-oriented programming & procedural oriented programming paradigm
- The source code of python is converted into an immediate form called bytecode.
- Cross OS language (Windows, Linux, Unix, and Mac)
- Dynamic Typing: Variables can be reassigned with to any different data type, thus python is dynamically typed language. since variable can change type readily. other languages like c, java are statically typed where variables are stuck with their originally-assigned type

# Python3 v/s Python2

- Python-2 is legacy version and outdated and Python-3 is latest and future version of Python language
- Python-3 is not backwards compatible to Python 2 (but vice-versa is true)
- Python-3 Readiness: http://chhantyal.net/py3readiness/#.X48I5J0zZUw (Tells you list of packages that are now supported by Python)
- latest version of python would be build upon Python-3 only

# Install Python

- https://www.python.org/downloads/
- Documentation: https://docs.python.org/3/

---

# Run Python File

- python3 <file_name>

---

# Python Interpreter

- Python Interpreter is REPL to play with Python its not meant for projects

---

# Maths Operator

<!--
- + Addtion
- - Subtraction
- * Multiply
- / Divide
- ** Exponentiation
- % Modulo
- // Integer Division
-->

- PEMDAS (P- parentheses, E- exponent, M- multiplication, D- division, A- addition, S- subtraction)

---

# Comments

- Single line comment ==> #
- Python does not really have a syntax for multi line comments, but you can use a multiline string. Python will ignore string literals that are not assigned to a variable, you can add a multiline string (triple quotes) in your code

---

# Variables

- Variables Must be assigned to some value before used ==> Error : NameError: name 'variable_name' is not defined
- Syntax- variable_name: type_name
- variables are like containers for storing data, pull it out later. They can hold all sorts of things like - number, boolean, string, etc
- variable in python is like a variable in mathematics: it is named symbols that holds a value
- Thinking like JAR
- variables are always assigned with the variable name on the left and then the value on the right of equals sign.
- variables must be assigned before they are used
- Naming Restriction:
  - variables must start with a letter or underscore
  - rest of the variable name must consist of letters, numbers or underscores
  - variable names are case-sensitive
- Naming Conventions/Style/Guide-lines:
  - variable should be lower_snake_case (betweeen words underscore)
  - variable should be lower cases
  - constants should be CAPITAL_SNAKE_CASE
  - Class name should be UpperCamelCase
  - variable that starts and ends with two underscores (called dunder for double underscore) are supposed to be private or should left alone ex-
  <!-- __no_touch__ -->

# Data Types

- Primitive Data type:
  - Boolean Type: bool
  - Numeric Types: int, float, complex
  - Text Type: str
- Secondary Data Type: (Data-Structures)
  - Sequence Types: list, tuple, range (Ordered sequence of values like array)
  - Mapping Type: dict (Collection of key/value pairs)
  - Set Type: set, frozenset
  - Binary Type: bytes, bytearray, memoryview
- Special Value: None (Similar to null in other languages)

---

# Strings

- String literals in python can be declared with either Single quotes or double quotes. (Just like JS)
- Escape Character/Sequence: this are meta-characters which get interpreted by python to do somthing special:
  - https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#literals
- Formatting String: There are several ways to format a string in python to interpolate a variable. New way in Python3 is F-String
- String is indexed (ie- each character has indicies)

---

# Converting DataTypes

- Can explicitly convert data type of the variable by using the built-in type as a function
  a1 = 12.3423
  b1 = int (a1)
